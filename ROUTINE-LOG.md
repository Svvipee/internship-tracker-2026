# Routine Log — Winter 2026 / Spring 2027 Internship Tracker

Running log of every automated routine run. Each run reads this log first to avoid re-verifying known-dead links, then does fresh research, updates `build.mjs`, regenerates the spreadsheet, stages application drafts for new fully-verified postings, and commits/pushes.

## 2026-09-19 ~19:15 UTC (first logged run)

No prior ROUTINE-LOG.md existed — `build.mjs` already contained a seeded `rows`/`checked` dataset from earlier (unlogged) work, so this run treated that as the baseline and did NOT re-verify any of its existing entries; it began fresh research from that baseline forward.

### What was searched
Three parallel research passes:
1. **Priority re-checks** (per task instructions): GE Aerospace (Lynn, MA) Spring 2027 co-ops, Draper Laboratory (Cambridge, MA), MIT Lincoln Laboratory (Lexington, MA), plus Symbotic and Amazon Robotics re-checks.
2. **Aerospace/defense majors**: RTX/Raytheon/Collins Aerospace/Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky, Textron/Textron Aviation, GD Electric Boat, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, Leidos, BAE Systems.
3. **Broader manufacturing/robotics/automotive/space sweep**: Boston-area robotics/hardware companies (iRobot, Vicarious Surgical, Desktop Metal/Markforged, Vecna Robotics, Locus Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Berkshire Grey, PTC, Analog Devices), general manufacturing majors (Caterpillar, John Deere, Honeywell, 3M, Rockwell, Parker Hannifin, Eaton, Danaher, Cummins, Stanley Black & Decker), automotive/EV (Rivian, GM, Ford, Stellantis, Lucid), and space/launch (SpaceX, Rocket Lab, Firefly, Sierra Space, Relativity, Anduril).

All candidates were checked against the actual posting URL (company career site/ATS), not aggregator summaries, per the verification bar. Where a site was JS-rendered/bot-protected and couldn't be independently confirmed, entries were added as "Partial —" with an explicit note of what could/couldn't be verified, never silently dropped or silently upgraded.

### Added to `rows` (21 new entries)
- **MIT Lincoln Laboratory** — Microfabrication Industrial Eng Co-Op, Lexington MA — **Yes**, Jan–Aug 2027.
- **Draper Laboratory** (Cambridge, MA) — Systems Engineering Co-Op and Electro-Mechanical Instrument Co-op, Spring 2027 — **Partial** (Workday req pages blocked, confirmed via Draper's own listings page).
- **Amazon Robotics** — Industrial Development Engineer Intern/Co-op 2027, Westborough MA — **Yes** but flagged: shared pipeline for summer/spring/fall, Spring 2027 placement not guaranteed.
- **Anduril Industries** — Winter 2027 Mechanical Engineer Co-op and Winter 2027 Systems Engineer Co-op, **Quincy, MA (Boston metro!)** — **Yes**, confirmed live on Greenhouse.
- **Rivian** — Manufacturing Engineering (Normal, IL) and Design for Reliability (Irvine, CA), both Spring 2027 Co-Op — **Yes**.
- **SpaceX** — Spring 2027 Engineering Internship/Co-op, multiple sites — **Yes**.
- **Rocket Lab** — Mechanical Engineering Intern and Systems Engineering Intern, both Spring 2027, Long Beach CA — **Yes**.
- **Collins Aerospace / Pratt & Whitney / RTX (Collins)** — 5 Winter/Spring 2027 co-ops (Windsor Locks CT, Middletown CT, Winston-Salem NC, Cedar Rapids IA, Jamestown ND) — **Partial** (Workday blocked, confirmed via aggregator mirrors with req IDs and Sept 13–16 2026 posting dates).
- **Northrop Grumman** — 2027 Spring Mechanical Engineering Co-op, Chandler AZ — **Partial**.
- **Boston Dynamics** — Mechanical Engineering Co-Op, Waltham MA — **Partial**.
- **Berkshire Grey** — Spring 2027 Hardware Quality Co-op, Bedford MA — **Partial**.
- **Emerson** — R&D Engineering Co-Op and Project Engineering Co-op, both Spring 2027, PA/MI — **Partial**.

### Added/updated in `checked` (26 entries touched)
- **Corrected two stale exclusions**: Anduril (previously "Summer 2027 only" — a separate Winter 2027 Quincy MA cohort has since opened) and the Tesla/SpaceX/Apple/... group (SpaceX now has a genuine Spring 2027 posting, split out).
- **GE Aerospace (Lynn, MA)**: all previously-known reqs now return "no longer posted" or HTTP 410 — worse than before, no live Spring 2027 Lynn req found.
- **Draper Laboratory**: Sensor Electrical Engineering Co-op and Optics-Physics Sensor Engineering Co-op confirmed live but excluded — discipline mismatch (electrical/optics, not on Hamza's list).
- **Symbotic**: re-confirmed zero internship/co-op postings.
- **Amazon Robotics**: old req 3088739 confirmed dead (404), superseded by new req added to `rows`.
- New exclusions this run: BAE Systems (Nashua NH — Summer 2027 only), Textron Aviation (still can't confirm year), GD Electric Boat (new Spring 2027 cycle likely exists but no verifiable link found), Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky (site migrated, nothing found), L3Harris & Leidos (discipline mismatch — software/EE only), MIT Lincoln Lab's Rapid Prototyping co-op (Fall 2026 only, wrong season), Boston Dynamics' second req (season unstated), Eaton (broken link), Cummins (re-confirmed empty board), and a large batch of manufacturing/robotics/auto companies with no qualifying postings (iRobot, Vicarious Surgical, Desktop Metal/Markforged, Vecna, Locus, PTC, Analog Devices, Caterpillar, John Deere, Honeywell, 3M, GM, Ford, Stellantis, Lucid, Stanley Black & Decker, Rockwell, Parker Hannifin, Danaher (Canada-located), Firefly, Sierra Space, MathWorks, CIRTEC Medical, Relativity Space).

### Staged applications created (9 files, `staged-applications/`)
One per fully-verified ("Yes", not "Partial") new posting: MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Anduril (Mechanical + Systems), Rivian (Manufacturing Eng + Design for Reliability), SpaceX, Rocket Lab (Mechanical + Systems), and Amazon Robotics. Each contains the posting URL, known eligibility notes (citizenship/ITAR where relevant, GPA/enrollment where known), and a checklist of what to verify/prepare — draft only, nothing submitted.

### Spreadsheet regenerated
`npm install xlsx --no-save && node build.mjs` → printed `done`; `.xlsx` file changed (38KB → 65KB, confirmed via `git diff --stat`).

### Worth re-checking next time
- **GD Electric Boat** (Groton, CT) — a new Spring 2027 cycle appears to exist per aggregator evidence, but the official portals (ebcareers.com, careers-gdeb.icims.com) blocked automated fetch — check directly in-browser.
- **Textron Aviation** — "Spring Co-Op – Electronics Modules Engineer" still can't be dated; careers.textron.com remains JS-blocked.
- **Eaton** — Spring 2027 co-op wave exists generally but the specific link died; look for a fresh one.
- **RTX Massachusetts sites** (Andover/Tewksbury/Woburn) — RTX clearly has an active Winter/Spring 2027 co-op wave (5 reqs found this run, none in MA); their own MA-specific search page is JS-rendered and returned nothing — worth trying again.
- **Analog Devices, Sierra Space, Danaher (US site), Caterpillar (next cycle)** — cycles not yet posted per this run's findings; likely to open in the next 4–8 weeks.
- **Amazon Robotics req 10536817** — re-check periodically whether the posting narrows to a specific term, since it's currently a shared summer/spring/fall pipeline.

### ⚠️ Push failure
`git push -u origin master` failed with a 403: **"Claude doesn't have GitHub access to Svvipee/internship-tracker-2026 for your organization."** All of this run's work (build.mjs, the regenerated .xlsx, this log, and 9 staged-application files) is committed locally on `master` (commit `a3018f9`) but has NOT reached GitHub. An org admin needs to install the Claude GitHub App (https://github.com/apps/claude/installations/select_target) or reconnect GitHub from claude.ai settings before the next run's push — and before this run's commit — can land. **The next run should attempt to push this pending local commit before doing new work**, so nothing is lost or duplicated.
